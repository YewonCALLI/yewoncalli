## Hi I'm YewonðŸ‘‹

I am a creative technologist focused on developing experimental tools for expanding digital expression. My expertise lies in creating systems that bridge between different forms - from text to interactive experiences, and from screen-based graphics to physical objects. I specialize in building computational tools that combine natural language processing and form generation with intuitive interfaces, exploring how digital tools can expand our creative and physical making possibilities.
