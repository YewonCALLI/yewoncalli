## Hi I'm YewonðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer focusing on developing tools for creators. <br>
My expertise lies in developing computational design tools that bridge digital and physical fabrication. 
I am skilled in software development that entails novel combinations of machine learning, computer graphics, and interaction design for design applications such as paper craft converters and Korean typography generators. <br>

My current works focus on transforming complex computational methods into intuitive interfaces for creative expression.
