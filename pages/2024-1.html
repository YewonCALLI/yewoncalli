In this course, around a dozen participants, including myself, contributed by curating and submitting our own unique text data. I submitted a poetic essay inspired by the works of Dai Yoko and George Eliot. <br><br> We meticulously broke down these text contributions into individual words and classified them into 15 different parts of speech, such as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. Additionally, we labeled each word based on six criteria: dog-cat, utilitarian-romantic, static-dynamic, concrete-intangible, satisfying-irritating, and hard-soft. <br><br>Using the scores from these labels, created a method to measure the similarity between words, allowing our system to suggest synonyms within the framework we developed.<br><br> <img style="width: 100%;"src="../assets/image/wordwideweb/wordwideweb4.gif"><br><br>Now, I invite you to explore: do the words you select feel similar to the ones orbiting them? Or do they seem entirely different? Embrace the strange and unexpected gaps as you play the Word Wide Web game. <br><br><a href="https://solarword.vercel.app/">Word Wide Web</a> is a game where you weave together words that are similar or seem related within the system we created. The goal is to weave as many words as possible in a short amount of time. Speed is the key to victory! <br><br><img style="width: 100%;"src="../assets/image/wordwideweb/wordwideweb5.gif"><br><br><img style="width: 100%;"src="../assets/image/wordwideweb/wordwideweb6.gif"> P.S.

The artist observed a generational divide between the elderly and younger populations and aimed to bridge this gap using AI. The chatbot blends conversations from various generations in Hongyeon-gil, incorporating data gathered from street interviews, online surveys, and web crawling. This data was fine-tuned on GPT-3.5 to create a chatbot that speaks with a unified voice representing multiple perspectives. The chatbot shares not only the history, geography, and culture of Hongyeon-gil but also personal experiences and memories, as if lived by one person. It is accessible to everyone through an avatar website.<br><br><b>Interview Excerpt:</b><br><br><b>Eunchong:</b> I understand that AI chatbots require extensive data preprocessing before they can generate coherent speech. Can you explain the AI generation process for this project?<br><br><b>Yewon:</b> I first visited Hongyeon-gil in July. Over six months, we familiarized ourselves with the area, approached residents, and conducted interviews and Google Form events. I even remember directly asking people about their thoughts on Hongyeon-gil. We spent time talking to residents and visitors, collecting information, which we then transcribed using Clova Note.<br><br><b>Eunchong:</b> How does your work differ from other AI models?<br><br><b>Yewon:</b> While traditional chatbots provide answers based on objective information, the data I collected reflects the language habits, emotions, and everyday experiences of Hongyeon-gil residents. The stories are more personal and capture the essence of life in Hongyeon-gil.<br><br><b>Eunchong:</b> What was the most challenging part of creating the AI chatbot?<br><br><b>Yewon:</b> Capturing the lives of the residents within the chatbot was the most challenging part. Processing and training the data involved repeatedly listening to interview recordings, which often moved me deeply. It felt more like archaeology or exploration than development. This project was a small challenge to the current AI scene, as it wasn’t about perfection.<br><br><b>Eunchong:</b> Your AI sometimes says unexpected things, which gives it a novelist-like quality. You played a significant role in this project, especially by emphasizing communication across regions and generations. I believe the project's success is largely due to your efforts in listening to the elderly, gathering feedback, and incorporating it into your work.`,

However, during interviews with the elderly residents, we found that most had never visited any of the art galleries in their own neighborhood. In response, ABT launched a project that engaged the elderly in art through ongoing interaction.<br><br><img style="width: 100%;"src="../assets/image/abt/abt-photo1.gif"><br><br>As a member of Team ABT, I participated as an artist while also taking charge of the branding.

Additionally, given that our three artists work with media, I incorporated a rave-like vibe commonly used in media art.

Both Jisu and I experienced the intense and often overwhelming environment of Korea’s private education system during high school. Our memories of attending a science high school, where a hyper-competitive atmosphere dictated our lives solely based on test scores, are far from positive. <br><br>It was only after entering university that we realized life has so much more to offer than just grades. While our high school experiences remain a source of negativity, our pure love for science has never waned. Inspired by the curiosity and excitement we felt when we first encountered science, we decided to create our own unique science museum. We believe that science is a discipline that everyone should engage with and reflect on. That’s why we organized an event called Cell on the Beach, inviting people to join and enjoy. <br><br> To introduce the fun side of science, we decided to use the concept of 'memes.' The term 'meme' was originally coined by Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene, deriving from the word 'gene' to describe a unit of cultural transmission. We hope to preserve and share our experiences with science through these memes. You can download the science memes we created from the link below.<br><br> <img style="width: 100%;"src="../assets/image/cellonthebeach/photo1.png"> <br><br>On the Cell on the Beach website, users can interact with various objects that represent cellular organelles, and collaboratively produce sounds by clicking on them. The sound you trigger can be heard on another device! Typically, in games or the metaverse, we perceive each other’s presence through avatars. However, this experience allows you to sense the presence of others in an online space without any visual effects. <br><br><img style="width: 100%;"src="../assets/image/cellonthebeach/photo2.png"><br><br>Secondly, participants can enjoy a simple DJing experience. We built a MIDI controller using Arduino, allowing users to control various sounds from the pre-prepared tracks. This feature was the crowd favorite!<br><br><img style="width: 100%;"src="../assets/image/cellonthebeach/photo4.png"><br><br>Finally, we created a photo booth where visitors can capture memories. We developed a Cell on the Beach photo filter and built the system for taking and sharing pictures ourselves. Through these experiences, we aim to challenge the conventional approaches to education and celebrate the boundless joy of scientific discovery.`,
